        ## About Directory traversal attack
    </h1>
    <p> 
        A directory traversal (or path traversal) attack exploits insufficient security validation or sanitization of user-supplied 
        file names, such that characters representing "traverse to parent directory" are passed through to the operating 
        system's file system API. An affected application can be exploited to gain unauthorized access to the file system.
    </p>
    <p> 
        Directory traversal is also known as the ../ (dot dot slash) attack, directory climbing, and backtracking. 
        Some forms of this attack are also canonicalization attacks.
    </p>

    <h1>
        ## Preventive measures
    </h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Process URI requests that do not result in a file request, e.g., executing a hook into user code, before continuing below.</li>
        <li>When a URI request for a file/directory is to be made, build a full path to the file/directory if it exists, and normalize all characters (e.g., %20 converted to spaces).</li>
        <li>It is assumed that a 'Document Root' fully qualified, normalized, path is known, and this string has a length N. Assume that no files outside this directory can be served.</li>
        <li>Ensure that the first N characters of the fully qualified path to the requested file is exactly the same as the 'Document Root'.</li>
        <li>If so, allow the file to be returned.</li>
        <li>If not, return an error, since the request is clearly out of bounds from what the web-server should be allowed to serve</li>
    </ul>

        ## Demo Example
    </h1>
    <p>
        Below, you can see a file system hierarchy of our vulnerable server which lets you read files through its
        '/files/read' endpoint. The purpose of this design was to let users load dynamically menu of 
        ice cream flavours based on a day of the week. Authors didn't care much about security and didn't include
        any code which would prevent accessing anything other than 'ice-cream' directory with menus in markdown.
    </p>

    <h3>
        ### The hierarchy looks like this:
    </h3>
    <textarea disabled>
.
|--- etc
|       |--- passwd  <---- try to read this file
|
|--- wwwroot
        |
        |--- data
        │      │
        |      |--- ice-cream
        │      │      |
        |      |      |--- monday.md   <---- default
        |      |      |--- tuesday.md
        │      │
        |      |--- README.md
        │
        |--- index.html
    </textarea>

    <p>
        Vulnerable endpoint <i>'/files/read'</i> is expecting filename input passed as URL querry parameter called <i>file</i>.
        Typing <i>../</i> represents directory one level higher in the hierarchy. Try passing filename <i>monday.md</i> as input and send request to the server.
    </p>
    <div class="traversal window">
        <div class="traversal url row">
            <div class="traversal rowname">GET URL:</div> 
            <span id="traversal-url">http://192.168.0.101/files/read?file=</span>
            <span id="traversal-file">monday.md</span>
        </div>
        <div class="traversal input row">
            <div class="traversal rowname">Input:</div>
            <input id="file-input" oninput="update_url(this.id);" type="text" value="monday.md">
        </div>
        <div class="traversal btn row" onclick="send_request();">Send request</div>
        <div class="traversal row">Response:</div>
        <div id="traversal-message" class="traversal message row"></div>
    </div>

    <div class="security row">
        <p style="width: 250px;">Enable security measure: (path validation)</p>
        <div id="enable-security" class="checkbox" onclick="{toggle_checkbox(this.id); toggle_security();}"></div>
    </div>

    <p>
        As you can see, ice cream flavour menu was returned by the server. Now, if you type <i>../README.md</i>, you will be able
        to read some file outside of <i>ice-cream</i> directory! Now, feel free to explore rest of the filesystem. :) 
    </p>

    <h2>
        ### What happened?
    </h2>
    <p> 
        Since vulnerable endpoint doesn't validate received path, anything given by user is executed by file reading method.
        If the attacker doesn't know the filesystem hierarchy, it can be hard to guess and find certain files. Yet many projects
        will be structured in similar and standardized ways so finding the right path to crucial configuration files might be
        just a matter of time and determination.
    </p>

    <h2>
        ### Protection example: Path Validation
    </h2>
    <p> 
        The simple and yet powerful validation technique used on the server side after enabling security measure does the following:
        <ul>
            <li>Determine path prefix to which our endpoint will have access to.</li>
            <li>Use <i>join()</i> method from <i>path</i> library to concatenate required prefix with given path to desired file (the  
                <i>join()</i> method will return resulting path stripped off the <i>../</i> notation).</li>
            <li>Validate that resulting path string starts with required prefix (<i>string.startsWith()</i> method can be used).</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
